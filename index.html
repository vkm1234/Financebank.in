        <h4>Car Loan</h4>
        <p>A Vehicle Loan is a loan that allows you to purchase two and four wheelers for personal use.There are two
          primary methods of borrowing money to buy a car:
          direct and indirect. A direct loan is one that the borrower arranges with a lender directly. Indirect
          financing is arranged by the car dealership where the car is purchased.
          Legally, an indirect “loan” is not technically a loan; when a car buyer obtains financing facilitated by a
          dealership, the buyer and dealer sign a Retail Installment Sales Contract rather than a loan agreement.</p>
